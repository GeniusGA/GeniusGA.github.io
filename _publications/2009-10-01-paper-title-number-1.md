excerpt: 'A Natural Language Processing (NLP) based procedure is developed for detecting systematic non-meritorious consumer complaints, simply called systematic anomalies, among complaint narratives. While classification algorithms are used to identify meritorious complaints, in the case of smaller and frequent systematic patterns of non-meritorious complaints, those algorithms may falter due to a variety of reasons, including technical ones as well as natural limitations of human analysts. Therefore, at the next stage after classification, the complaint narratives are converted into quantitative data, which are then analyzed using indices for detecting systematic anomalies. An illustration of the entire procedure is provided using complaint narratives from the Consumer Complaint Database of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The results suggest that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms other selected classifiers. Although classification results with the VADER intensity pertinent to the featurization step have lower accuracy, they contain fewer non-meritorious complaints than those without the VADER intensity.'
